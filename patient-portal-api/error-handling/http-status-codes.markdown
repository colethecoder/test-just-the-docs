See Login to find out more about authorization. || 403 | Forbidden | You don’t have rights to perform current operation. || 404 | Not found |     || 405 | Method not allowed | For example when you use GET instead of POST. || 424 | Method Failure |     || 500 | Internal Server Error |     || 501 | Not implemented |     |The table above doesn’t contain all HTTP status codes that can be generated by the Meddbase server and not all responses from the server contains the ServiceExceptionData object.
