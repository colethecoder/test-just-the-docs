# Authentication TokenThe authentication token needs to be included in every request sent to the API gateway while the user is logged-in. The token is a unique string generated for the current logged-in session. It changes on login/logout and expires together with the session if the session is not accessed for a lengthy period.The only way to get the token is from the response of the Login request and it is mandatory for all methods where the user is logged-in.If the passed token is not valid, an Invalid Token exception (see Error handling) is thrown.One of the purposes of the token is to protect against the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).Note that you do not need to manage the authentication token if you use our API Javascript library. It manages this for you automatically.
