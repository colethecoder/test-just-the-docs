# GetSitesGets possible sites for the specific appointment type. A site is a geographically-unique place. Each site may include additional 'locations', which are typically rooms at the site (Room 123, Surgery, etc.), but may also be geographically different places associated with the site (First floor, West wing, Building 3, etc.).The API will only present you with locations which mean something to a user. So they're unlikely to get a choice about Room 1, 2, 3, etc. but they may get a choice about Site: My Bank, Location: Floor 1, Floor 50, Floor 100, etc.## JavaScript library method```patientportal.anonAppointment.getSites({appointmentType: &lt;appointment-type&gt;,lat: &lt;lat&gt;,long: &lt;long&gt;,payerType: &lt;payer-type&gt;});```## HTTP MethodGET## ****Url****/patientportalapi/anon-appointment/sites## URL Parameters| appointment-type | string | Type of the appointment provided by the API upon GetAppointmentTypes. || --- | --- | --- || lat<br><br>long | decimal (optional) | Latitude and Longitude from GPS so server can sort sites by distance.<br><br>Latitudes and Longitudes are defined using numerals that have a precision to 6 decimal places.
