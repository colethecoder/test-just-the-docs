# Anonymous Appointment Search
This section provides methods for making anonymous (i.e. not authenticated) appointment searches. The methods are deliberately similar to the appointment search API documented in section 9 ‘Appointments’.Each method in this section needs the client to provide the ASP.NET_SessionId key in a cookie (see Login).
